Triangle++
==========
This is a fork of Marek Krajewski's TrianglePP which is an updated version of Piyush Kumar's ("http://compgeom.com/~piyush) OO/C++ wrapper (https://bitbucket.org/piyush/triangle/overview) for the original J.P Shevchuk's Triangle package written in C.
It can create Delaunay triangulations and constrained Delaunay triangulations.
